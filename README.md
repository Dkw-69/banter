  I had alot of fun building this project
  I used https://chatengine.io api for the backend
#### Packages used
  @antdesignicons - For providing beautiful icons out of the box
  axios - For making requests to the Chat Engine api
  react-chat-engine - A free serverless chat api
#### Installation

  Cd into that folder in the terminal
  Clone this repo
  Type npm install, and you are good to go!
